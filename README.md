X-Ray Machine
   The X-Ray Machine offers a unique opportunity to explore the human body. The application is a powerful tool which allows you to learn how the human body is constructed. In X-Ray Mode you are provided with a view of bones, organs, and the vascular system of the body. 

   In X-Ray Mode you can move the X-Ray to view different areas of the body. The application also provides the ability to change the body's position to X-Ray the body in different positions. You can even zoom in to get a closer look at the body or it's construction.
